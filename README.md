Microservice for food request in Mauá Institute of Technology.

## The Project 📽

### Introduction and Objectives ⁉

The main objetive of the project if to create a system that anyone can order food to any of Mauá Institute of Technology restaurants.

### Clean Architecture 🧼🏰

The purpose of the project is to learn and create a Clean Architecture for microservices stateless with AWS Lambda which is a way of structuring
the code in layers, each of which has a
specific responsibility. This architecture is based on the principles of SOLID and books like "Clean Architecture: A
Craftsman's Guide to Software Structure and Design" by Robert C. Martin.

To develop this project we used clean_mss_template as a base, which is a template for creating microservices with clean architecture.
